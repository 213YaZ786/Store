/**
 * The fills of zones, taken from the dynamic palette so they carry the
 * wallpaper's colour.
 *
 * Zones used surfaceContainerLow, which Material builds from the neutral
 * palette: on a red wallpaper it came out a pink so pale it could not be told
 * from the page, and on most wallpapers it read as grey. Checked on a tablet
 * emulator with a red seed, the zones looked fixed while the switches and the
 * headings were red. Mixing in primaryContainer keeps the calm of a surface
 * and makes the zone follow the wallpaper visibly. The share is lower in dark
 * themes, where primaryContainer is a strong mid tone.
 *
 * Text stays on onSurface: the mix sits between two tones Material already
 * pairs with it, so the contrast of every label is kept.
 *
 * Shared across the apps of this base: edit Modules/shared, then run sync.sh.
